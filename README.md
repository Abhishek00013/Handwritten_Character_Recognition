# Handwritten Character Recognition

Due to digitization of everything it is import to recognize handwritten characters. 
Writing style of person can vary at great extents and it becomes difficult to recognize. 
Additionally, the noise, uneveness of light in the source material can cause in error.

<h2> Objective </h2>
To correctly recognize the scanned or uploaded images of handwritten texts.

<h2> Abstract </h2>
We have proposed a CNN architecture that uses keras as an interface for tensorflow library. 
The model has been validated for english characters and digits. 
Dataset put-to-use for english is ‘EMNIST_ByClass’ [1]. 
The model achieved 87% accuracy for EMNIST_ByClass dataset.
